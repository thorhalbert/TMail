# TMail - Thor's Mail - written in around 1984 originally for RSTS/E Decus-C - ported to MS-DOS in the mid 80s.

This was originally patterned after BSD command line email.  It was somewhat different from BSD.  It was also one of the first big C project that I actually did.   

I had this integrated into dec PathWorks (decnet and later tcp/ip) and the system could send and receive vms mail and ultimately could do bangpath mail on the usenet.  We ran this until Eudora came along around the time we got a real internet connection.  We were a decnet node (on a whopping 14.4k sync line) and usenet node (19200 baud telebit trailblazer) before that.
